=head1 NAME

Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar - functions from Hydrogen::Scalar applied to C<$_>

=head1 VERSION

This documentation is for Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar 0.016,
which is based on Sub::HandlesVia::HandlerLibrary::Scalar 0.037.

=cut

=head1 FUNCTIONS

Each function implicitly operates on C<< $_ >>, expecting it to be a scalar.

=cut

use Exporter::Shiny qw(
    make_getter
    make_setter
);

=head2 C<< make_getter() >>

Operates on C<< $_ >>, which must be a scalar.

Returns a getter coderef.

=cut

sub make_getter {

    package Hydrogen::Scalar::__SANDBOX__;
    @_ == 0
      or Hydrogen::croak( "Wrong number of parameters for make_getter; usage: "
          . "Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar::make_getter()" );
    my $s = $_;
    sub { unshift @_, $s; $_ }
}

=head2 C<< make_setter() >>

Operates on C<< $_ >>, which must be a scalar.

Returns a setter coderef.

=cut

sub make_setter {

    package Hydrogen::Scalar::__SANDBOX__;
    @_ == 0
      or Hydrogen::croak( "Wrong number of parameters for make_setter; usage: "
          . "Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar::make_setter()" );
    my $s = $_;
    sub { my $val = shift; unshift @_, $s; ( $_ = $val ) }
}

=head1 EXPORT

No functions are exported by this module by default. To import them all (this is usually a bad idea), use:

    use Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar -all;

To import a particular function, use:

    use Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar 'make_getter';

To rename functions:

    use Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar 'make_getter' => { -as => 'myfunc' };

On Perl 5.37.2+, you can import lexically:

    use Hydrogen::Topic::Scalar -lexical, 'make_getter';

See L<Exporter::Tiny::Manual::Importing> for more hints on importing.
